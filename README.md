# soccertrends

## Intro
<p> This repository contains the data for over +25k soccer matches over the last few decades. By working with this data I was able to perform some introductory analysis into some soccer trends and analyze questions through cleaning and visualizing the data. </p> 

## Directions

<p>Load in all the .csv files to your local directory to perform analysis on the data. To see what steps I took, view the soccer trends HTML or ipynb file. </p>


## Key Points
    * The majority of the pertinent data (goalscorer, assist, goaltype, etc.) is contained in the match.csv file
    * There are many games in this data set with missing entries, so keep this in mind when cleaning your data
